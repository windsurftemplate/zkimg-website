## Key Legal Principles Applied

### 1. Avoided Absolute Guarantees
❌ **Don't Say:**
- "100% fraud prevention"
- "Guaranteed to catch all fakes"
- "Perfect detection"
- "Never fails"

✅ **Instead Say:**
- "Helps reduce fraud risk"
- "Verifies photo authenticity"
- "Cryptographically proves device origin"
- "Reduces false positives"

### 2. Clarified AI Detection Claims
❌ **Don't Say:**
- "Detects all AI-generated images"
- "AI fraud detection system"
- "99.5% accuracy identifying deepfakes"

✅ **Instead Say:**
- "Proves photos came from authenticated devices"
- "Verifies capture timestamp and location"
- "Helps detect suspicious images"

**Why:** We verify device origin, NOT AI content. Different legal liability.

### 3. Added Legal/Compliance Disclaimers
❌ **Don't Say:**
- "Court-admissible evidence"
- "HIPAA compliant"
- "Meets all regulatory requirements"

✅ **Instead Say:**
- "Designed for legal proceedings" + "Consult your legal team"
- "HIPAA-ready" (if true) + "Healthcare providers remain responsible"
- "Supports compliance requirements" + "Verify in your jurisdiction"

### 4. Industry-Specific Disclaimers Added

**Insurance:**
> "Rial Labs assists in claim verification but does not make claim decisions. Final determination remains with insurance professionals."

**Legal:**
> "Consult with legal counsel regarding admissibility in your jurisdiction. Rial Labs provides technical documentation, not legal advice."

**Healthcare:**
> "Designed to support HIPAA compliance. Healthcare providers remain responsible for patient privacy and regulatory compliance."

## Summary

All website content has been updated to:
- ✅ Use legally safe, qualified language
- ✅ Avoid absolute guarantees and specific fraud prevention claims
- ✅ Clarify what Rial does (device verification) vs. doesn't do (AI detection, claim validation)
- ✅ Add comprehensive legal pages and disclaimers
- ✅ Provide industry-specific professional guidance
- ✅ Under-promise and over-deliver legally

**The #1 Principle Applied:**
> It's better to say "helps reduce fraud" and prevent 90% than to say "prevents all fraud" and miss one case that leads to a lawsuit.
